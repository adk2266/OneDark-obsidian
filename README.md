# OneDark Theme for Obsidian
Note in case anyone ever looks at this fork for some reason: I have switched (for now - I'm really fickle) to [Kognise's atom theme](https://github.com/adk2266/obsidian-atom), so probably won't be tinkering with this one anymore

This theme is based [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro). And One Dark Pro is based on Atom's default One Dark theme.

Currently only support **Dark mode**.\
Please use the `obsidian.css`\
`obsidian-base.css` is the base css extracted from Obsidian.
